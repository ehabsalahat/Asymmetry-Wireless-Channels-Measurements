Wireless Measurements Dataset used to study Channel Asymmetry (Frequency Response). To plot the measurements, just change the "path" in the "demoX.m" file of each scenario to that of your device. 

For comments, please contact: ehab.salahat@live.com.

The measurements will be updated continously so please have a regural check on this page. If used, please cite:
